DaemonSets:
-----------

    - DaemonSets ensure one copy of the pod is always present in each node
    - As Nodes are added to the cluster, Pods are added
    - As nodes are removed from the cluster, these pods are garbage collected
    - Delete the DaemonSets will delete the PODs it created


Commands:
=========
    kubectl get nodes
    kubectl create -f monitoring-daemonset.yml
    kubectl get pods -o wide
    kubectl get ds
    kubectl describe ds monitoring-daemon
    kubectl delete ds monitoring-daemon
